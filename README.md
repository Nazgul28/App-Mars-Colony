# App "Mars Colony" project - AngularJS

Project 4 - RED Academy.

In this project I could practice my skills in AngularJS!

I also implemented basic ajax GET and POST requests using Angular’s $http service in order to:
Save a new colonists information,
Save a new alien encounter,
Fetch a list of recent encounters,
Remove a colonist from the colony,
Determine if a colonist has already registered,
Create a new ailen type,
Create a new encounter.

I implemented and managed AngularJS modules: 
Service,
Factory,
Controller,
Directive.

Other achieved goals:  

-Implement HTML push-state navigation;
-Implement the ui-router plugin;
-Define a route for each view in the specification;
-Restrict access to the ‘Registration’ route when the user has already registered;
-Implement the following Angular directives:
ng-repeat,
ng-click,
ng-class,
ng-show,
ng-hide,
ng-if.

I could play with CSS3 transform - see "pulse" (first screen).
